5. Add a new repository secret named `WEATHER_API_KEY` containing your API key for `Actions` in `Secrets and variables`
6. Add the following section to your README.md file. The workflow will replace this comment with the weather:

```
7. Create a folder named `.github` and create a `workflows` folder inside it, if it doesn't exist.
8. Create a new file named `weather-profile-workflow.yml` with the following contents inside the workflows folder:
```yml
name: Update Weather
on:
  schedule: # run workflow automatically
    - cron: '0 */3 * * *' # runs every three hours
  # allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

          readme-path: README.md # relative path of the README file. something like: README, README.md, src/README, src/README.md, etc.
